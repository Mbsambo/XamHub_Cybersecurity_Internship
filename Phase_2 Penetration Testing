Phase 2: Penetration Testing
Task: Set Up a Penetration Testing Environment

Description: Install Kali Linux, Metasploit, and Nmap. Configure a testing lab with intentionally vulnerable applications like DVWA.
Outcome: A fully functional penetration testing lab environment for conducting various cybersecurity tasks.
Task: Conduct Reconnaissance on a Target System

Description: Use tools like Nmap and OSINT techniques to gather information about a target systemâ€™s domain, open ports, and services.
Outcome: Ability to perform effective reconnaissance, collecting actionable information for penetration testing.
Task: Exploit Vulnerabilities Using Metasploit

Description: Identify vulnerabilities using scanning tools and exploit them using Metasploit. Document the process and results.
Outcome: Practical experience in exploiting system vulnerabilities and documenting the exploitation steps for reporting purposes
