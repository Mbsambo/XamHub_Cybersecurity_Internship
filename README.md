Research Basics of Network Security Monitoring
Network traffic monitoring is a crucial aspect of network management that involves observing and analyzing the data flowing across a network. This process helps identify potential issues, optimize performance, and ensure security.
Packets: The fundamental unit of data transmission in a network. Packets contain information like the source and destination addresses, data payload, and control information.
Protocols: Sets of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received on a network. Common protocols include TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). and FTP (File Transfer Protocol). Â  
Firewalls: Security devices that filter network traffic based on defined rules. They prevent unauthorized access to a network by blocking malicious traffic and unwanted connections.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Software or hardware solutions that monitor network traffic for signs of malicious activity. They analyze network traffic patterns and compare them to known attack signatures to detect and alert administrators about potential security threats.
